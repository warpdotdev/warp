 # Similar to our approach in bash, we start a shell with the minimal amount of
 # startup (i.e. --no-rcs) and then take over by executing the shell startup.
 # We only support the local zsh case for now.

 # Note that we indent everything in this top-level script by one space in order
 # to hide from history.
 #
 # Also, note that we put the 'eval' on the same line as the 'read' separated by a semi-colon
 # rather than on its own line after the HEREDOC.  This seems to work around a bug in zsh
 # where the buffer was getting messed up after processing the heredoc about 1/50 of the time.
