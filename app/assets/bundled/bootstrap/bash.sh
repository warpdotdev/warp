 # 1. We remove the guard for duplicate inclusion since we have different logic in warp where we execute this function.
 # 2. As mentioned, we separate the actual installation step to install_bashpreexec. I just took those last three lines
 # out of bash-preexec and separated them to that different function.

     # V0.4.1
     #
     
     # General Usage:
     #
     #  1. Source this file at the end of your bash profile so as not to interfere
     #     with anything else that's using PROMPT_COMMAND.
     #
     #  2. Add any precmd or preexec functions by appending them to their arrays:
     #       e.g.
     #       precmd_functions+=(my_precmd_function)
     #       precmd_functions+=(some_other_precmd_function)
     #
     #       preexec_functions+=(my_preexec_function)
     #
     #  3. Consider changing anything using the DEBUG trap or PROMPT_COMMAND
     #     to use preexec and precmd instead. Preexisting usages will be
     #     preserved, but doing so manually may be less surprising.
     #
     #  Note: This module requires two Bash features which you must not otherwise be
     #  using: the "DEBUG" trap, and the "PROMPT_COMMAND" variable. If you override
     #  either of these after bash-preexec has been installed it will most likely break.
    
 #### In Warp's inclusion of bash-preexec, we don't include these two guards
 #### at the beginning of the script. Instead, we use bash_preexec_imported and __bp_imported to
 #### determine whether we want to execute bash-preexec or not.
     # Make sure this is bash that's running and return otherwise.
     #if [[ -z "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]]; then
     #    return 1;
