# Tech Spec: Render image previews in the code review panel

**Issue:** [warpdotdev/warp#12093](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/12093)
**Product spec:** [`product.md`](./product.md)
**Researched at commit:** `118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be`

## Context

The code review panel renders each changed file through `CodeReviewView::render_file_content`. Binary files short-circuit to a static "Binary file - no diff available" text node — this is the exact branch the feature replaces:

- [`code_review_view.rs (5214-5295) @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/code_review/code_review_view.rs#L5214-L5295) — `render_file_content`; the `if file.file_diff.is_binary` branch at L5231 is where image previews slot in (before the existing text placeholder).
- [`code_review_view.rs (2587-2720) @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/code_review/code_review_view.rs#L2587-L2720) — `build_view_state_for_file_diffs` builds each `FileState` from a `FileDiffAndContent`. Per-file view state (incl. the "Open file" button at L2646-L2660) is constructed here.
- [`code_review_view.rs:356 @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/code_review/code_review_view.rs#L356) — `FileState` (the per-file view struct).

Diff data model and how binary content is (not) loaded:

- [`diff_state/mod.rs (167-224) @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/code_review/diff_state/mod.rs#L167-L224) — `FileDiff` (`is_binary` at L176) and `FileDiffAndContent` (`content_at_head: Option<String>`, explicitly `None` for binary files, L210-L224).
- [`diff_state/local.rs:2342 @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/code_review/diff_state/local.rs#L2342) — `get_file_content_at_head`, which loads base content via `git show HEAD:<path>`. Binary files never reach it.
- [`warp_util/src/git.rs (8-58) @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/crates/warp_util/src/git.rs#L8-L58) — `run_git_command` decodes stdout with `String::from_utf8_lossy` (L45), which **corrupts binary bytes**. Reading image blobs needs a bytes-preserving variant.
- [`diff_state/remote.rs @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/code_review/diff_state/remote.rs) — remote/PR diffs arrive over the `GetDiffState` protobuf RPC carrying only text content. Out of scope (see `product.md` Non-goals).

Existing infrastructure to reuse (no new image stack needed):

- [`app/src/util/image.rs @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/util/image.rs) — `infer_mime_type` (magic-byte sniffing via `infer`, extension fallback via `mime_guess`) and `SUPPORTED_IMAGE_MIME_TYPES`.
- [`block.rs (6802-6816) @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/ai/blocklist/block.rs#L6802-L6816) — the canonical raw-bytes → image pattern: `AssetCache::insert_raw_asset_bytes::<ImageType>(id, &bytes, ctx)` then reference via `AssetSource::Raw { id }`. The WarpUI `Image` element renders it and supports `.first_frame_preview()`.
- Feature-flag pattern in this view: `FeatureFlag::GitOperationsInCodeReview.is_enabled()` ([`code_review_view.rs:1151 @ 118c6a4`](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/blob/118c6a4ef9d58110f11b75217d416ed269e9e8be/app/src/code_review/code_review_view.rs#L1151)).

## Proposed changes

Gate the entire feature behind a new `FeatureFlag::ImagePreviewInCodeReview` (add via the `add-feature-flag` skill). When the flag is off, behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.

**1. Binary-safe git read — `crates/warp_util/src/git.rs`.**
Add `run_git_command_bytes(repo_path, args) -> Result<Vec<u8>>` that mirrors `run_git_command` but returns `output.stdout` without UTF-8 decoding (factor the shared `Command` setup so the existing string variant calls it and decodes). Keep the same exit-code handling.

**2. Image classification + byte loading — `app/src/code_review/diff_state/local.rs`.**
For a `FileDiff` with `is_binary == true` (flag on, local diffs only), attempt to load preview bytes:
- **Base side** (statuses other than new/untracked): `git show <rev>:<path>` via `run_git_command_bytes`, where `<rev>` mirrors the revision `get_file_content_at_head` already uses (HEAD or merge-base for branch mode).
- **Working side** (statuses other than deleted): read `repo_path/<path>` from disk.
- Enforce the **≈10 MB cap per side** before decoding — use `git cat-file -s <rev>:<path>` for the base and `fs::metadata` for the working file; skip the side if over cap, marking it `TooLarge`.
- Classify each loaded buffer with a helper built on `infer_mime_type`, accepting only `image/png|jpeg|gif|webp` (raster only — SVG excluded). A buffer that doesn't sniff to one of these (text-`.png`, LFS pointer) is rejected → no preview for that side. Decode dimensions with the `image` crate (already a workspace dep) for the metadata line.

Introduce `ImagePreviewData { old: Option<ImageSide>, new: Option<ImageSide> }` where `ImageSide` is `Image { bytes: Arc<Vec<u8>>, mime, width, height, byte_len }` or `TooLarge { byte_len }`. Add `image_preview: Option<ImagePreviewData>` to `FileDiffAndContent` (it already carries the "expensive, do-not-clone" payload, so this is the natural home; `Arc` the bytes so the view can register them without a deep copy). `image_preview` is `Some` only when at least one side classified as an image or `TooLarge`.

**3. View state — `code_review_view.rs`.**
In `build_view_state_for_file_diffs`, when `file.image_preview.is_some()`, register each `ImageSide::Image`'s bytes once via `AssetCache::insert_raw_asset_bytes::<ImageType>` with a stable id (`code-review-img-{old|new}-{path}@{rev}`), and store an `image_preview_state: Option<ImagePreviewState>` (the `AssetSource::Raw` ids + metadata + status) on `FileState`. No `editor_state` is built for image files.

In `render_file_content`, add a branch **before** the `is_binary` text placeholder (L5231): if `image_preview_state` is present, render the preview — per-status layout from `product.md` §2 (single image for added/deleted/renamed-unchanged; old + new for modified). Each side is an `Image::new(AssetSource::Raw { id }, CacheOption::Original).first_frame_preview()` plus a theme-styled metadata line (dimensions + size) and a status badge, wrapped in the existing `styled_file_content_container`. A `TooLarge` side or a file where every side was rejected falls through to the **existing** binary placeholder (optionally a "too large to preview" variant) — satisfying the graceful-fallback invariants without new error UI.

**Tradeoff (byte loading location).** Bytes are loaded eagerly during diff computation (alongside `content_at_head`) rather than lazily in the view. This matches the existing content-loading pattern and keeps the view synchronous; the ≈10 MB cap and image-only restriction bound memory. A lazy `AssetSource::Async` fetch is possible but adds a loading-state path the product spec deliberately doesn't require.

## Testing and validation

Unit (`cargo nextest run`):
- `run_command_bytes` round-trips arbitrary binary (PNG fixture bytes in == bytes out), proving §1 doesn't corrupt blobs — foundational to `product.md` §1.
- Classification helper: PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP magic bytes accepted; SVG, a text file with `.png` extension, and an LFS pointer rejected → `product.md` §8 (misclassification guard).
- Cap logic: a >10 MB side yields `TooLarge`; the other side still classifies → `product.md` §5.

Integration (`crates/integration`, Builder/TestStep — see `warp-integration-test` skill), with PNG fixtures committed to a scratch repo:
- Added / deleted / modified PNG render previews with the correct per-status content → `product.md` §1, §2; metadata line present, no "0/0" stat → §3.
- Corrupt/truncated image bytes fall back to the placeholder and the rest of the panel still renders → §6.
- Modified image with an unreadable base blob renders the new side and notes the old is unavailable → §7.
- Flag off → identical-to-today binary placeholder (regression guard).

## Risks and mitigations

- **Binary corruption via the string git path** — the dedicated `run_git_command_bytes` is the mitigation; never route image blobs through `run_git_command`.
- **Memory from buffering image bytes in the diff model** — bounded by the per-side ≈10 MB cap and the image-only restriction; `Arc` avoids copies into the view; the existing `TextureCache` evicts GPU textures for off-screen images.
- **"Open file" zoom assumption** — `product.md` defers full-size zoom on the premise that the existing "Open file" button (L2646) renders the image. This is **unverified**: the button emits `OpenInNewTab`, and it's not confirmed that opening an image file renders it (vs. raw/text). Verify during implementation; if it doesn't render, reopen the zoom decision as a follow-up rather than silently shipping a dead deferral.

## Parallelization

Not beneficial. The change is small and tightly coupled across four files in one crate (`git.rs` → `local.rs` → `mod.rs` → `code_review_view.rs`) with a strict data dependency (bytes accessor → loader/model → view). Parallel agents would collide on `code_review_view.rs` and serialize on the model change anyway. Implement sequentially on branch `MattSkala/code-review-image-preview` as a single PR.
