  /**
   * When enabled, causes all node properties and methods to skip over invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside {@link InstanceNode | instances}.
   * This makes operations like document traversal much faster.
   *
   * Note: Defaults to true in Figma Dev Mode and false in Figma and FigJam
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * Accessing and modifying invisible nodes and their descendants inside instances can be slow with the plugin API.
   * This is especially true in large documents with tens of thousands of nodes where a call to {@link ChildrenMixin.findAll} might come across many of these invisible instance children.
   *
   * If your plugin does not need access to these nodes, we recommend setting `figma.skipInvisibleInstanceChildren = true` as that often makes document traversal significantly faster.
   *
   * When this flag is enabled, it will not be possible to access invisible nodes (and their descendants) inside instances. This has the following effects:
   *
   * - {@link ChildrenMixin.children} and methods such as {@link ChildrenMixin.findAll} will exclude these nodes.
   * - {@link PluginAPI.getNodeByIdAsync} will return a promise containing null.
   * - {@link PluginAPI.getNodeById} will return null.
   * - Accessing a property on an existing node object for an invisible node will throw an error.
   *
   * For example, suppose that a portion of the document tree looks like this:
   *
   * Frame (visible) → Instance (visible) → Frame (invisible) → Text (visible)
   *
   * The last two frame and text nodes cannot be accessed after setting `figma.skipInvisibleInstanceChildren = true`.
   *
   * The benefit of enabling this flag is that document traversal methods, {@link ChildrenMixin.findAll} and {@link ChildrenMixin.findOne}, can be up to several times faster in large documents that have invisible instance children.
   * {@link ChildrenMixin.findAllWithCriteria} can be up to hundreds of times faster in large documents.

   * Closes the plugin. You should always call this function once your plugin is done running. When called, any UI that's open will be closed and any `setTimeout` or `setInterval` timers will be cancelled.
   *
   * @param message - Optional -- display a visual bell toast with the message after the plugin closes.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * Calling `figma.closePlugin()` disables callbacks and Figma APIs. It does not, however, abort the plugin. Any lines of Javascript after this call will also run. For example, consider the following plugin that expects the user to have one layer selected:
   *
   * ```ts title="Simple closePlugin"
   * if (figma.currentPage.selection.length !== 1) {
   *   figma.closePlugin()
   * }
   * figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = 0.5
   * ```
   *
   * This will not work. The last line will still run, but will throw an exception because access to `figma.currentPage` has been disabled. As such, it is not recommended to run any code after calling `figma.closePlugin()`.
   *
   * A simple way to easily exit your plugin is to wrap your plugin in a function, instead of running code at the top-level, and always follow `figma.closePlugin()` with a `return` statement:
   *
   * ```ts title="Early return"
   * function main() {
   *   if (figma.currentPage.selection.length !== 1) {
   *     figma.closePlugin()
   *     return
   *   }
   *   figma.currentPage.selection[0].opacity = 0.5
   * }
   * main()
   * ```
   *
   * It's good practice to have all input validation done at the start of the plugin. However, there may be cases where the plugin may need to close after a chain of multiple function calls. If you expect to have to close the plugin deep within your code, but don't want to necessarily want the user to see an error, the example above will not be sufficient.
   *
   * One alternative is to use a top-level try-catch statement. However, you will need to be responsible for making sure that there are no usages of try-catch between the top-level try-catch and the call to `figma.closePlugin()`, or to pass along the close command if necessary. Example:
   *
   * ```ts title="Top-level try-catch"
   * const CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG = "_CLOSE_PLUGIN_"
   * function someNestedFunctionCallThatClosesThePlugin() {
   *   throw CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG
   * }
   *
   * function main() {
   *   someNestedFunctionCallThatClosesThePlugin()
   * }
   *
   * try {
   *   main()
   * } catch (e) {
   *   if (e === CLOSE_PLUGIN_MSG) {
   *     figma.closePlugin()
   *   } else {
   *     // >> DO NOT LEAVE THIS OUT <<
   *     // If we caught any other kind of exception,
   *     // it's a real error and should be passed along.
   *     throw e
   *   }
   * }
   * ```

   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * - `timeout`: How long the notification stays up in milliseconds before closing. Defaults to 3 seconds when not specified. Set the timeout to `Infinity` to make the notification show indefinitely until the plugin is closed.
   * - `error`: If true, display the notification as an error message, with a different color.
   * - `onDequeue`: A function that will run when the notification is dequeued. This can happen due to the timeout being reached, the notification being dismissed by the user or Figma, or the user clicking the notification's `button`.
   *   - The function is passed a `NotifyDequeueReason`, which is defined as the following:
   * ```ts
   *  type NotifyDequeueReason = 'timeout' | 'dismiss' | 'action_button_click'
   *  ```
   * - `button`: An object representing an action button that will be added to the notification.
   *    - `text`: The message to display on the action button.
   *    - `action`: The function to execute when the user clicks the button. If this function returns `false`, the message will remain when the button is clicked. Otherwise, clicking the action button dismisses the notify message.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * The `notify` API is a convenient way to show a message to the user. These messages can be queued.
   *
   * If the message includes a custom action button, it will be closed automatically when the plugin closes.
   *
   * Calling `figma.notify` returns a `NotificationHandler` object. This object contains a single `handler.cancel()` method that can be used to remove the notification before it times out by itself. This is useful if the notification becomes no longer relevant.
   *
   * ```ts
   * interface NotificationHandler {
   *   cancel: () => void
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * An alternative way to show a message to the user is to pass a message to the {@link PluginAPI.closePlugin} function.

   *  example().catch((e) => figma.closePluginWithFailure(e))

   * The newly created rectangle may not be included in the v1 version. As a work around, you can wait before calling `saveVersionHistoryAsync()`. For example,

   * @param options - An object that may contain the following optional parameters:
   * - `visible`: Whether the UI starts out displayed to the user. Defaults to `true`. You can use `figma.ui.show()` and `figma.ui.hide()` to change the visibility later.
   * - `width`: The width of the UI. Defaults to 300. Minimum is 70. Can be changed later using `figma.ui.resize(width, height)`
   * - `height`: The height of the UI. Defaults to 200. Minimum is 0. Can be changed later using `figma.ui.resize(width, height)`
   * - `title`: The title of the UI window. Defaults to the plugin name.
   * - `position`: The position of the UI window. Defaults to the last position of the iframe or the center of the viewport. If specified, expects an X/Y coordinate in the canvas space (i.e matches x/y values returned by `<PluginNode>.x` and `<PluginNode>.y`)
   * - `themeColors`: Defaults to `false`. When enabled, CSS variables will be added to the plugin iframe to allow [support for light and dark themes](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/css-variables).
   *
   * Note: If the position specified is outside of the user's viewport, the iframe will be moved so that it remains in the user's viewport.

   * @remarks
   *
   * The easiest way to use this API is to load the HTML file defined in the manifest. This enables writing a separate HTML file which can be accessed through the [`__html__`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/global-objects#html) global variable.

   * If `type` is 'run', then this function will be passed a `RunEvent`.
   * If `type` is 'drop', then this function will be passed a `DropEvent`.
   * If `type` is 'documentchange', then this function will be passed a `DocumentChangeEvent`.
   *
   * Otherwise nothing will be passed in.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * This API tries to match Node.js conventions around similar `.on` APIs.
   *
   * It's important to understand that the `.on` API runs the callbacks **asynchronously**. For example:
   *
   * ```ts
   * figma.on("selectionchange", () => { console.log("changed") })
   * console.log("before")
   * figma.currentPage.selection = []
   * console.log("after")
   *
   * // Output:
   * // "before"
   * // "after"
   * // "changed"
   * ```
   *
   * The asynchronous nature of these APIs have a few other implications.
   *
   * The callback will not necessarily be called each time the event happens. For example, this will only trigger the event once:
   *
   * ```ts
   * figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createRectangle()]
   * figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createFrame()]
   * ```
   *
   * Nor will the ordering of the event trigger and event registration affect whether the callback is called.
   *
   * ```ts
   * figma.currentPage.selection = [figma.createFrame()]
   * figma.on("selectionchange", () => { "this will get called!" })
   * ```
   *
   * ## Available event types
   *
   * ### `"currentpagechange"`
   *
   * This event will trigger when the user navigates to a different page, or when the plugin changes the value of `figma.currentPage`.
   *
   * ### `"selectionchange"`
   *
   * This event will trigger when the selection of the **current page** changes. This can happen:
   * - By user action.
   * - Due to plugin code.
   * - When the current page changes (a `"currentpagechange"` event always triggers a `"selectionchange"` event).
   * - When a selected node is deleted.
   * - When a selected node becomes the child of another selected node (in which case it is considered indirectly selected, and is no longer in `figma.currentPage.selection`)
   *
   * Note also that changing the selection via the plugin API, then changing it back to its previous value immediately still triggers the event.
   *
   * ### `"documentchange"`
   *
   * If the plugin manifest contains `"documentAccess": "dynamic-page"`, you must first call {@link PluginAPI.loadAllPagesAsync} to access this event. Because this may introduce a loading delay, consider using more granular alternatives, such as the `"stylechange"` event, or using {@link PageNode.on | PageNode.on} with the `"nodechange"` event.
   *
   * This event will trigger when a change is made to the currently open file. The event will be called when nodes/styles are either added, removed, or changed in a document.
   *
   * The callback will be passed with a DocumentChangeEvent with the below interface:
   *
   * ```ts
   * interface DocumentChangeEvent {
   *   documentChanges: DocumentChange[]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Note: Note that `DocumentChangeEvent` has a `documentChanges` property with an array of `DocumentChange`s. Figma will not call the 'documentchange' callback synchronously and will instead batch the updates and send them to the callback periodically.
   *
   * There are 6 different {@link DocumentChange} types that we currently notify on and we might add more in the future. Each of these changes has a `type` property to distinguish them:
   *
   * | Change                                                           | `type` property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   * |------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   * | [`CreateChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChange#createchange)               | `'CREATE'`                | A node has been created in the document. If a node with nested children is being added to the document a `CreateChange` will only be made for the highest level parent that was added to the document.             |
   * | [`DeleteChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChange#deletechange)               | `'DELETE'`                | A node has been removed from the document. If a node with nested children is being removed from the document a  `DeleteChange`  will only be made for the highest level parent that was removed from the document. |
   * | [`PropertyChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChange#propertychange)           | `'PROPERTY_CHANGE'`       | A property of a node has changed.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
   * | [`StyleCreateChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChange#stylecreatechange)     | `'STYLE_CREATE'`          | A style has been added to the document.                                                                                                                                                                            |
   * | [`StyleDeleteChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChange#styledeletechange)     | `'STYLE_DELETE'`          | A style has been removed from the document.                                                                                                                                                                        |
   * | [`StylePropertyChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/DocumentChange#stylepropertychange) | `'STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE'` | A style has had a property changed.                                                                                                                                                                                |
   *
   *
   * #### Special cases
   *
   * We currently never notify a `'documentchange'` listener in the following scenarios:
   * - if the change was caused directly by your plugin in a `documentchange` callback
   * - if an instance sublayer was updated by a change to a main component
   * - if a node was updated as a result of a style changing
   *
   * #### Example
   * Here is an example of exhaustively checking changes to the document and logging them to the console.
   *
   * ```ts
   * figma.on("documentchange", (event) => {
   * for (const change of event.documentChanges) {
   *   switch (change.type) {
   *     case "CREATE":
   *       console.log(
   *         `Node ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`
   *       );
   *       break;
   *
   *     case "DELETE":
   *       console.log(
   *         `Node ${change.id} deleted by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`
   *       );
   *       break;
   *
   *     case "PROPERTY_CHANGE":
   *       for (const prop of change.properties) {
   *         console.log(
   *           `Node ${
   *             change.id
   *           } had ${prop} changed by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`
   *         );
   *       }
   *       break;
   *
   *     case "STYLE_CREATE":
   *       console.log(
   *         `Style ${change.id} created by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`
   *       );
   *       break;
   *
   *     case "STYLE_DELETE":
   *       console.log(
   *         `Style ${change.id} deleted by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`
   *       );
   *       break;
   *
   *      case "STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE":
   *        for (const prop of change.properties) {
   *          console.log(
   *             `Style ${
   *               change.id
   *             } had ${prop} changed by a ${change.origin.toLowerCase()} user`
   *           );
   *        }
   *        break;
   *     }
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * For a more involved example see our [plugin samples on GitHub](https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/document-change).
   *
   * ### `"textreview"`
   *
   * Note: This event is only available to plugins that have the `"textreview"` capability in their `manifest.json` and the plugin is running in text review mode.
   *
   * `"textreview"` events allow plugins to review text in a document and act as either a replacement or a supplement to native spell check.
   *
   * This event is triggered periodically when the user is typing in a text node. The callback will be passed with a TextReviewEvent with the below interface:
   * ```ts
   * interface TextReviewEvent {
   *   text: string
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The `text` property is the text that the user has currently typed into the node.
   *
   * A `"textreview"` event listener should return a promise that resolves to an array of `TextReviewRange` objects. Each `TextReviewRange` object represents a single range of text that should be marked as either an error or a suggestion. The `TextReviewRange` interface is defined as:
   * ```ts
   * type TextReviewRange = {
   *   start: number
   *   end: number
   *   suggestions: string[]
   *   color?: 'RED' | 'GREEN' | 'BLUE'
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The `start` property is the index of the first character in the range. The `end` property is the index of the last character in the range. The `suggestions` property is an array of strings that represent the suggestions for the range. The `color` property is optional and can be used to change the color of the underline that is drawn under the range. If no color is specified the underline will be red.
   *
   * For more information read our in depth guide on [text review plugins](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/textreview-plugins).
   *
   * ### `"drop"`
   *
   * This event will trigger when objects outside Figma (such as elements from other browser windows, or files from the local filesystem) are dropped onto the canvas.
   *
   * It can also be triggered by a special `pluginDrop` message sent from the UI. See the [Triggering drop events from the UI](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/creating-ui#triggering-drop-events-from-the-ui) section for more details.
   *
   * The callback will be passed a `DropEvent` with the below interface. It should return `false` if it wants to handle the particular drop and stop Figma from performing the default drop behavior.
   * ```ts
   * interface DropEvent {
   *   node: BaseNode | SceneNode
   *   x: number
   *   y: number
   *   absoluteX: number
   *   absoluteY: number
   *   items: DropItem[]
   *   files: DropFile[]
   *   dropMetadata?: any
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * - The `node` property contains the node where the drop landed. This will sometimes be the page node if the drop didn't land on anything in the canvas, or if target node is locked or cannot be a parent of another node.
   * - The `x` and `y` properties are coordinates relative to the node drop target
   * - The `absoluteX` and `absoluteY` properties are absolute canvas coordinates
   * - The `items` property is an array of `DropItem` objects. You will see multiple objects if a drop contains multiple, non-file data types. If there are no data items, this array will be empty.
   * - The `files` property is an array of dropped files represented as `DropFile` objects. If no files are present, this array will be empty.
   * - The `dropMetadata` property comes from drop events [explicitly triggered by the UI](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/creating-ui#triggering-drop-events-from-the-ui).
   *
   * Items and files will conform to the below interfaces:
   *
   * ```ts
   * interface DropItem {
   *   type: string // e.g. "text/html", "text/uri-list", etc...
   *   data: string
   * }
   *
   * interface DropFile {
   *   name: string // file name
   *   type: string // e.g. "image/png"
   *   getBytesAsync(): Promise<Uint8Array> // get raw file bytes
   *   getTextAsync(): Promise<string> // get text assuming file is UTF8-encoded
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * See the Icon Drag-and-Drop and PNG Crop examples in the [figma/plugin-samples](https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples) repository for plugins that implement this API.
   *
   * #### UI Recommendations
   *
   * When the plugin registers a drop callback, it should give the user instructions with either text in the plugin UI or [`figma.notify()`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-notify) (if the plugin does not show a UI) telling them what to do.
   *
   * [`figma.notify()`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-notify) can be called with the `timeout` option set to `Infinity` to make the notification show for as long as the plugin is open.
   *
   * ### `"close"`
   *
   * This event will trigger when the plugin is about to close, either from a call to `figma.closePlugin()` or the user closing the plugin via the UI.
   *
   * This is a good place to run cleanup actions. For example, some plugins add UI elements in the canvas by creating nodes. These UI elements should be deleted when the plugin is closed. Note that you don't need to call `figma.closePlugin()` again in this function.
   *
   * **You should use this API only if strictly necessary, and run as little code as possible in the callback when doing so**. When a user closes a plugin, they expect it to be closed immediately. Having long-running actions in the closing callback prevents the plugin for closing promptly.
   *
   * This is also not the place to run any asynchronous actions (e.g. register callbacks, using `await`, etc). The plugin execution environment will be destroyed immediately when all the callbacks have returned, and further callbacks will not be called.
   *
   * ### `"run"`
   *
   * This event is triggered when a plugin is run. For plugins with parameters, this happens after all parameters have been enter by the user in the quick action UI. For all other plugins this happens immediately after launch.
   *
   * The callback will be passed a `RunEvent` that looks like:
   * ```ts
   * interface RunEvent {
   *   parameters?: ParameterValues
   *   command: string
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * - The `parameters` property is of type [`ParameterValues`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma-parameters#parametervalues), and contains the value entered for each parameter.
   * - The `command` argument is the same as [`figma.command`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/figma#command), but provided here again for convenience.
   *
   * Handling the `run` event is only required for plugins with parameters. For all plugins it can still be a convenient spot to put your top level code, since it is called
   * on every plugin run.
   *
   * ### `"stylechange"`
   *
   * Triggered when any styles in the document change.
   *
   * The callback will receive a StyleChangeEvent with the below interface:
   *
   * ```ts
   * interface StyleChangeEvent {
   *   styleChanges: StyleChange[]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * There are 3 different {@link StyleChange} types. Each of these changes has a `type` property to distinguish them:
   *
   * | Change | `type` property | Description |
   * | --- | --- | --- |
   * | [`StyleCreateChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StyleChange#stylecreatechange) | `'STYLE_CREATE'` | A style has been added to the document. |
   * | [`StyleDeleteChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StyleChange#styledeletechange) | `'STYLE_DELETE'` | A style has been removed from the document. |
   * | [`StylePropertyChange`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/StyleChange#stylepropertychange) | `'STYLE_PROPERTY_CHANGE'` | A style has had a property changed. |
   *
   * ### `"timerstart"`
   *
   * This event will trigger when somebody starts a timer in the document. This can happen either by a user (either the current user or a multiplayer user) starting the timer from the UI, or triggered by plugin code. To inspect the current state of the timer when this event fires, use the `figma.timer` interface. For example:
   * ```ts
   * figma.on("timerstart", () => console.log(figma.timer.remaining))
   * figma.timer.start(300)
   *
   * // Output:
   * // 300
   * ```
   *
   * ### `"timerpause"`
   *
   * Triggered when a timer that is running is paused.
   *
   * ### `"timerstop"`
   *
   * Triggered when the timer is stopped.
   *
   * ### `"timerdone"`
   *
   * Triggered when the timer is running and reaches 0 time remaining.
   *
   * ### `"timerresume"`
   *
   * Triggered when a timer that is paused is resumed.
   *
   * ### `"timeradjust"`
   *
   * Triggered when the total time on the timer changes. From the UI, it is only possible to add time to the timer. However, plugin code can both add and remove time from a running timer.

  /**

   * }
   * ```

  /**
   * This API creates a new node using the JSX API used by widgets.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * This API is a convenient and ergonomic way to bulk create nodes:
   *
   * ```tsx
   * const {Image, AutoLayout} = figma.widget;
   *
   * const node = await figma.createNodeFromJSXAsync(
   *  <AutoLayout fill="#F00" padding={20}>
   *    <Image src="https://picsum.photos/200" width={200} height={200}/>
   *  </AutoLayout>
   * )
   * ```
   *
   * Note: The JSX API does not support all features that exist on the equivalent SceneNode.
   * For example we don't support setting style ids or rendering instances via JSX.
   * You can always use `createNodeFromJSXAsync` to create a node and then set the properties you need on the created nodes.
   *
   * Note that to use this API you must configure your build system to compile tsx.
   *
   * There are 3 steps that you need to do to use this API in your plugin.
   *
   * 1. Install the `@figma/widget-typings` package.
   * 2. Add the appropriate compiler options to your `tsconfig.json` file
   * 3. Make sure that the file name for you code ends with the `.tsx` extension
   *
   * Note: If you are building a widget these should already be done for you.
   *
   * ### Install the widget typings
   *
   * In the directory of your plugin run the following command to install the widget typings:
   *
   * ```bash
   * npm i --save-dev @figma/widget-typings
   * ```
   *
   * ### Add compiler options to your `tsconfig.json` file
   *
   * You need to make sure that you add the following properties to your `tsconfig.json` file.
   * This configures typescript to transpile any jsx that you use into a way that our plugin runtime understands.
   *
   * ```json
   * "jsx": "react",
   * "jsxFactory": "figma.widget.h",
   * "jsxFragmentFactory": "figma.widget.Fragment",
   * ```
   *
   * Here is an example completed `tsconfig.json` file with the appropriate properties
   * added.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "compilerOptions": {
   *     "jsx": "react",
   *     "jsxFactory": "figma.widget.h",
   *     "jsxFragmentFactory": "figma.widget.Fragment",
   *     "target": "es6",
   *     "lib": [
   *       "es6"
   *     ],
   *     "strict": true,
   *     "typeRoots": [
   *       "./node_modules/@types",
   *       "./node_modules/@figma"
   *     ]
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * ```
   * Note: If you are using a build system (ex babel, vite, esbuild). You might have to configure the jsx options for your build system.
   *
   * ### Change file extension
   *
   * For plugins our default template puts your code in a `code.ts` file. You should rename this to `code.tsx` so that you can use jsx in your plugin.

   * @remarks
   *
   * This function only works to load fonts _already accessible in the Figma editor_ available to _plugins_. It does not load fonts from the internet.
   *
   * Tip: to load multiple fonts at the same time, you may find [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all) helpful.
   *
   * A common question is whether a plugin needs to be careful about calling `loadFontAsync(font)` for the same font multiple times. The answer is somewhat nuanced. The result of loading a font is cached, so calling `loadFontAsync` won't re-fetch the same font from disk. Therefore, calling `loadFontAsync` on every frame would be perfectly ok.
   *
   * However, note that `loadFontAsync` returns a Promise. Even if a Promise resolves immediately, it still needs to round-trip to the JavaScript event loop. So you probably shouldn't call `loadFontAsync` on the same font repeatedly inside a loop.

It allows you to create the new group while keeping all the grouped layers in the same absolute x/y locations.

   * A plugin for code generation needs to call `figma.codegen.on('generate')` to register a callback
   * that will be called when a user's selection changes in Dev Mode. This callback
   * should return an array of JSON objects that represent the sections in the
   * Inspect panel. The callback has a 15 second timeout and returns an error if it times out. For more
   * information, see the remarks.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * This callback can be async if your plugin needs to do some data fetching or other async
   * operation to generate code.
   *
   * Note: `figma.showUI` is not allowed within the generate callback. Instead, if [`figma.showUI`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-showui) is required in the generate callback, the `showUI` call should be moved outside of the callback and [`figma.ui.postMessage`](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-ui-postmessage) should be used within the callback instead. This ensures that the plugin is able to handle concurrent "generate" events.
   *
   * A plugin can also register a callback to handle events when codegen preferences are modified.
   * This is useful for codegenPreferences that need to open an iframe to get more user input.
   *
   * Note: Only preferences with `itemType: "action"` will trigger the `"preferenceschange"`` callback.
   *
   * The callback has a 15 second timeout. If the callback registered by `figma.codegen.on('generate')`
   * doesn't return a value within 15 seconds (for example, if the array of JSON objects takes too long to
   * construct), the operation ends and an error message is sent to the console:
   *
   * ```text title="Callback timeout error"
   * code generation timed out after 15 seconds
   * ```
   *
   * Additionally, a notification appears in the Code section of the Inspect panel to alert the
   * plugin's user of the error:
   *
   * ```text title="Inspect panel timeout error"
   * <Plugin name> ran into an issue
   *
   * This plugin is created by a third party and not
   * maintained by Figma, so to give feedback please
   * reach out to the developer.
   * ```
   *
   * The error in the Inspect panel includes a link to your plugin's community page.

   * If no `data` property is provided, it defaults to the value of the `name` property. I.e. the value

   * @param data -
   *
   * ```ts
   * {
   *   [command: string]: string // description
   * }
   * ```
   * e.g. `data = { myCommand: 'Short description' }`
   * @param command - The string that will be passed as `figma.command` when the plugin is run after the button is clicked. This command must be present in the [manifest](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/manifest#relaunchbuttons) under one of the `relaunchButtons`, which is used to look up the name to display for the button.
   * @param description - Up to three lines of text that will be displayed under the button to provide plugin specific information about the node or any clarification about the action the button will perform. This method will throw if description exceeds 1000 characters, but the UI will display even less (only 3 lines).
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * Each call to this method sets entirely new relaunch data, removing any relaunch data and associated buttons/descriptions from before. To maintain buttons from a previous call one can store the button information using [setPluginData](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/properties/nodes-setplugindata) and later fetch it with [getPluginData](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/api/PageNode#getplugindata) before passing it on to `setRelaunchData`.
   *
   * To use this API, the plugin manifest must include a `relaunchButtons` section: see the [manifest guide](https://developers.figma.com/docs/plugins/manifest#relaunchbuttons) for more information.
   *
   * Note: Note that if the `command` passed to this method does not match a command in the manifest, nothing will be displayed. Similarly if the name of a command in the manifest changes or is removed, then all buttons with that command will disappear. This behavior can be used to remove buttons when a particular action is no longer supported by the plugin.
   *
   * In Figma design, the relaunch data can also be placed on the {@link PageNode} or {@link DocumentNode}, to show a button and description when nothing is selected. Relaunch buttons added to the {@link PageNode} will be displayed on that page, combined with buttons from the {@link DocumentNode} that show on every page. This is not supported in FigJam.
   *
   * ## Examples
   *
   * ```ts title="manifest.json"
   * // With the following in the manifest:
   * "relaunchButtons": [
   *   {"command": "edit", "name": "Edit shape"},
   *   {"command": "open", "name": "Open Shaper", "multipleSelection": true}
   * ]
   * ```
   *
   * ```ts title="code.ts"
   * // Add two buttons (ordered by the above array from the manifest):
   * // * an "Edit shape" button with a description of "Edit this trapezoid
   * //   with Shaper" that runs the plugin with `figma.command === 'edit'`.
   * // * an "Open Shaper" button with no description that runs the plugin with
   * //   `figma.command === 'open'`.
   * node.setRelaunchData({ edit: 'Edit this trapezoid with Shaper', open: '' })
   *
   * // With the following in the manifest:
   * "relaunchButtons": [
   *   {"command": "relaunch", "name": "Run again", "multipleSelection": true}
   * ]
   *
   * // Pass an empty description to show only a button
   * node.setRelaunchData({ relaunch: '' })
   *
   * // Remove the button and description
   * node.setRelaunchData({})

   * ## Example Usages
   *
   * ### Find by node type

   *
   * // Find all text nodes in the current page
   * const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({
   *   types: ['TEXT']
   * })
   * ```
   *
   * ### Find by plugin data
   * ```ts
   * // Find all nodes in the current page with plugin data
   * // for the current plugin.
   * const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({
   *   pluginData: {}
   * })
   *
   * // Find all nodes in the current page with plugin data
   * // for the current plugin with keys "a" or "b"
   * const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({
   *   pluginData: {
   *     keys: ["a", "b"]
   *   }
   * })
   * ```
   *
   * ### Find by shared plugin data
   * ```ts
   * // Find all nodes in the current page with shared plugin data
   * // stored on the "bar" namespace
   * const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({
   *   sharedPluginData: {
   *     namespace: "bar"
   *   }
   * })
   *
   * // Find all nodes in the current page with shared plugin data
   * // stored on the "bar" namespace and keys "a" or "b"

   *   sharedPluginData: {
   *     namespace: "bar",
   *     keys: ["a", "b"]
   *   }
   * })
   * ```
   *
   * ### Combining criterias
   *
   * You can combine multiple criterias for further narrow your search.
   *
   * ```ts
   * // Find all text nodes in the current page with plugin data
   * // for the current plugin
   * const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({
   *   types: ["TEXT"],
   *   pluginData: {}
   * })
   *
   * // Find all text nodes in the current page with shared plugin data
   * // stored on the "bar" namespace
   * const nodes = figma.currentPage.findAllWithCriteria({

   * The position of a node relative to its **containing parent** as a {@link Transform} matrix. Not used for scaling, see `width` and `height` instead. Read the details page to understand the nuances of this property.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * ### Scale
   *
   * The `relativeTransform` is **not** used for scaling a node. The transform always has unit axes. That is, `sqrt(m00^2 + m10^2) == sqrt(m01^2 + m11^2) == 1`. In order to set the size of a node, use {@link LayoutMixin.resize} or {@link LayoutMixin.resizeWithoutConstraints}.
   *
   * Note: If you have a background in computer graphics, you may find it odd that we use the transform matrix in such a manner. This is because in 2D UI design, it's rare that you would want to scale the children when resizing a frame. And even if you did, it would be through more nuanced constraint settings that aren't captured by a transformation matrix.
   *
   * Also, if nodes had both a `width` and a separate `m00` scale property, it would be confusing to the users which one they're changing, especially during interactions like dragging.
   *
   * ### Container parent
   *
   * The relative transform of a node is shown relative to its container parent, which includes canvas nodes, frame nodes, component nodes, and instance nodes. Just like in the properties panel, it is **not** relative to its direct parent if the parent is a group or a boolean operation.
   *
   * Example 1: In the following hierarchy, the relative transform of `rectangle` is relative to `page` (which is just its position on the canvas).
   * ```text
   * page
   *   group
   *     rectangle
   * ```
   *
   * Example 2: In the following hierarchy, the relative transform of `rectangle` is relative to `frame`.
   * ```text
   * page
   *   frame
   *     boolean operation
   *       rectangle
   * ```
   *
   * One implication is that to calculate the absolute position of a node, you have to either use the {@link DimensionAndPositionMixin.absoluteTransform} property or multiply relative transform matrices while traversing up the node hierarchy while ignoring groups and boolean operations.
   *
   * Note: Why this complication? We do it this way because groups and boolean operations automatically resize to fit their children. While you _can_ set the relative transform of a group to move it, it's a property derived from the position and size of its children.
   * If the relative transform was always relative to it’s immediate parent, you could get into confusing situations where moving a layer inside a group by setting the relative transform changes the position of the parent, which then requires changing the relative transform of the child in order to preserve its on-screen position!
   *
   * ### Skew
   *
   * While it is possible to skew a layer by setting `m00`, `m01`, `m10`, `m11` to the right values, be aware that the skew will not be surfaced in the properties panel and may be confusing to the user dealing with a skewed node.
   *
   * ### Auto-layout frames
   *
   * The translation components `m02` and `m12` of the transform matrix is automatically computed in children of auto-layout frames. Setting `relativeTransform` on those layers will ignore the translation components, but do keep the rotation components.

   * Whether this node is a mask. A mask node masks its subsequent siblings.

   * @remarks
   *
   * Since a mask node masks all of its subsequent siblings, enabling `isMask` on a node that is not in a group-like container designed to stop mask propagation can have unintented consequences — that is, it may "mask" (often in practice, hide) more siblings than you intend. When enabling `isMask`, ensure you have contained its propagation propertly.

   * ```ts

   * const otherCircle2 = figma.createEllipse()

   * // - otherCircle2
   * // - otherCircle1
   * // - circleToMask
   * // - rect
   * //
   * // So if I enable `rect.isMask`, the rect will mask ALL other nodes,
   * // because they are all siblings.
   * //
   * // If I only want `rect` to mask `circleToMask`, I should group
   * // them first.
   * figma.group([rect, circleToMask], figma.currentPage,
   *             figma.currentPage.children.indexOf(circleToMask))
   * rect.isMask = true
   *
   * // Now `rect` only masks its siblings above it in its group
   * // (`circleToMask`) but not the circles outside of the group.
   * // In the layers panel this would look like:
   * // - otherCircle2
   * // - otherCircle1

   * The value that a variable resolves to depends on the following:
   *
   * - The node consuming the variable and which of the collection's modes is [currently selected in the node](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15343816063383)
   * - The variable's value for the selected mode
   * - If that value is an alias, then the resolved value is determined using the selected modes of each collection in the alias chain
   *
   * Note: It is not possible to statically determine the resolved value of a variable when there are multiple modes involved (either in the variable itself or in any variables in the alias chain).
   *
   *
   * The consuming node can have any combination of explicit or inherited variable modes per collection assigned to it.
   *
   * Here are some examples illustrating how variables can resolve to different values depending on the consuming node. These examples do not work if the current file is on the Starter plan, which is limited to a single mode.
   *
   * For a variable in a collection with two modes, it can resolve to up to two different values:
   *
   * ```ts title="Simple variable value resolution without aliasing"
   * // Create a collection with two modes and a variable with a different
   * // float value for each mode
   * const collection = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("Collection")
   * const mode1Id = collection.modes[0].modeId
   * const mode2Id = collection.addMode('Mode 2')
   * const variable = figma.variables.createVariable(
   *   "My Variable",
   *   collection,
   *   'FLOAT'
   * )
   * variable.setValueForMode(mode1Id, 1)
   * variable.setValueForMode(mode2Id, 2)
   *
   * const frame = figma.createFrame()
   * frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection, mode1Id)
   * // Output: {value: 1, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}
   * console.log(variable.resolveForConsumer(frame))
   *
   * frame.setExplicitVariableModeForCollection(collection, mode2Id)
   * // Output: {value: 2, resolvedType: 'FLOAT'}
   * console.log(variable.resolveForConsumer(frame))
   * ```
   *
   * For a variable in a collection with two modes with each value aliasing to different variables in another collection with two modes, it can resolve to up to four different values.
   *
   * ```ts title="Variable value resolution with aliasing"
   * // Create two collections:
   * // 1. A collection with two modes and two float variables
   * // 2. A collection with two modes and a variable aliasing to
   * //    different variables in the first collection
   * const collection1 = figma.variables.createVariableCollection("Collection 1")

   *
   * If you try to set the synced state for a widget with a different version of the same widget, that widget will automatically update to match the running widget's version. This ensures that the synced state values you set will always be compatible with the widget. A side effect of this is that a widget may get downgraded to a lower version.
